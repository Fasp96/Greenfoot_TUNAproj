This project was created as a project for University that consisted on creating a game in Greenfoot with the theme "Tuna" which is a group of university student in traditional university dress who play traditional instruments and sing serenades (for more information about it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna_(music)). 

After we delever the project we realized that we could have developed differently and with fewer classes and less repeated methods dispite the project being working fine and being an awesome game!!! :D
